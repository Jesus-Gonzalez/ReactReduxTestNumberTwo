## About this project
This is a simple Categorized Book Store made with React and Redux.  
The main goal is understanding how to handle Redux async actions.  
This is a **demo** repository and it is **not intended** to run on production environment.
I have used `redux-thunk` lib to handle async actions.  
I have used `axios` lib to make async HTTP requests.

## How should I run this?
Install dependencies as soon as you clone the project:  
`npm install`

Then run `npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server`  
using your favourite web browser


## Something else?

Feel free to fork the project, copy it, play with it or whatever you like.
Here I'm just exposing the very basics about async actions.

My next project will include React Router.

Stay tuned! :)
